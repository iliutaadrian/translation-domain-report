# translation-domain-report
Gives a percentage of translation between two languages of any page.

A small toll made in Python3 with BeautifulSoup.

The locale is set using URL parameters ex: https://golfgenius.com/leagues/4714361510128790175?locale=en

In this script we compare en(enghlish) and fr(french), but it can work with any languages if the domain has the correct configuration to support it.
